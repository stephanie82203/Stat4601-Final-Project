# Stat4601-Final-Project

## Project Objective
In this project, we analyze New York City condominium sales data to predict condo prices based on property size. We also compare model performance across NYC's five boroughs (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island), providing insights into real estate trends.

## Roles & Workflow 
### Project Setup
Members : Stephanie Cheng
- Outlined the entire project structure
- Created and maintained the GitHub repository

### Data Visualization
Members : David Wu
- Visualized raw vs. cleaned data to show improvements
_(Note: Data preprocessing for modeling was handled separately for the unsupervised and supervised learning tasks.)_

### Unsupervised Learning
Members : Stephanie Cheng
- Performed k-means clustering and vector quantization
- Visualized and interpreted clustering results

### Supervised Learning
Members : Trae Smith
- Built linear regression, regression tree, logistic regression, and classification tree models
- Evaluted model performance using R^2, MSE, accuracy and confusion matrix

### Final Comparison
Members : David Wu, Trae Smith, Haroun Sheikh
- Compared clustering vs prediction results
- Visualized pattern in prices, residuals, and accuracy among NYC's 5 boroughs
- Showed pros and cons of supervised vs unsupervised approaches

### Report Writing
Members : David Wu , Haroun Sheikh
- Led the writing of the final report
- All members contributed to editing and reviewing 

### Final Proofread
Members : Haroun Sheikh
- Assisted in completing unfinished code components
- Reviewed and ensured functionality of the final codebase

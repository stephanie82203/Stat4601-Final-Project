# Stat4601-Final-Project

## Project Objective
In this project, we analyze New York City condominium sales data to predict condo prices based on property size. We also compare model performance across NYC's five boroughs (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island), providing insights into real estate trends.
